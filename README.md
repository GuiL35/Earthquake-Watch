# Earthquake_Watch App

Get to know the earthquakes happening around you! Through this app, not only you could find some earthquakes around the world but also to know any earthquakes around locations you like. I fetched the data from USGS Earthquake API. When users input a location, the app calls GoogleMaps API and shows the earthquakes around that area in GoogleMaps.
